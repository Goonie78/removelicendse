Microsoft Graph PowerShell Code to Remove Licenses Assigned to Users
This code will allow you to remove licenses assigned per users.

In this case we're specifically removing "YAMMER_ENTERPRISE" Licenses assigned in E5 Licenses.

I've attached another example of removing "YAMMER_ENTERPRISE" Licenses in E3.

This code can be modified to remove other assigned licenses within Office 365 asked for.
